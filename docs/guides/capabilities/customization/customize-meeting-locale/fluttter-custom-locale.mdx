Dyte's UI Kit allows you to customize all the text within the video call interface. You can personalize the text to align with your specific locale needs.

Customizing the locale involves the following steps:


1. Integrate Dyte’s Flutter SDK into your application
2. Download the default language reference file
3. Change the locale
4. Add the modified file to your app


## Step 1: Integrate Dyte’s Flutter SDK into your application

To integrate Dyte's Flutter SDK into your application, follow the steps mentioned [here](/flutter/quickstart).

## Step 2: Download the default language reference

You can find the default language reference available at this [location](https://dyte-assets.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sdk/flutter_ui_kit/app_en.arb). The file contains all the text that is displayed on the video call interface.

## Step 3: Change the locale
Customize the text in the downloaded file to meet your requirements. You don't need to translate the entire file into your language; you can simply edit the specific text that you want to change.

For example, suppose you want to change the following text from English to Spanish:

Original English text:
```json
    "back": "Back",
    "waitingForTheHostToLetYouIn": "Wait for the host to let you in!",
    "chat": "Chat"
```
Translated Spanish text:

```json
    "back": "Atrás",
    "waitingForTheHostToLetYouIn": "¡Espera a que el anfitrión te permita entrar!",
    "chat": "Chat"
```


## Step 4: Add the modified file to your app

Once you have modified the file, you can add it to your app. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create an asset folder in your app's root directory.
2. Add the modified file to this folder.
3. Add the following code to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/app_en.arb
```

4. In the `DyteUIKitBuilder.build` method, pass the file path to the `arbPath` parameter.

```dart

final uiKit = DyteUIKitBuilder.build(uiKitInfo: uikitInfo, arbPath: 'path/to/arb/file');

```
