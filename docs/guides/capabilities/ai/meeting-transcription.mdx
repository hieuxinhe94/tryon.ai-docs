# Meeting Transcription

:::info alpha
The meeting transcription feature is currently in alpha, which means it is still being tested and evaluated, and may undergo some change. This feature is not accessible to the public at the moment and will be activated solely upon request, subject to our team's assessment of your usage and needs. If you wish to have this feature enabled for your organization, please [get in touch with us](https://dyte.io/contact).
:::

Dyte's meeting transcription allows you to transcribe your Dyte meetings in real-time, making it easy to capture important discussions and refer back to them later.
This guide will walk you through how to use this feature effectively.

:::info NOTE
Dyte's AI meeting transcription currently only supports English.

## Control transcriptions for participants using presets

You can control whether or not a participant's audio will be transcribe with the help of the `transcription_enabled` flag in the participant's preset.
All participants with the `transcription_enabled` turned on in their preset will be able to generate transcripts in real-time in a Dyte meeting.

You can create a new preset on our [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/presets), or using our [REST API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/post-presets)

:::info NOTE
To learn more about how to create and edit presets, see [Presets](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/capabilities/presets).

## Consuming transcripts

There are 2 ways in which these transcripts can be consumed.
1. Client core SDK: The transcripts can be consumed on the client-side using the Dyte SDK that's suitable for your platform. These transcripts are generated on the server in real-time.
2. Webhooks: The meeting transcript can be consumed via a [webhook after the meeting ends](#consume-transcript-via-a-post-meeting-webhook).

### Consuming transcripts in real-time

For consuming transcripts in real-time on the client SDK of your choice, you just need to ensure that the `transcription_enabled` flag is enabled in the preset.
Transcripts for all the participants having this flag set will be broadcasted in the meeting.

### Consume transcript via a post-meeting webhook

You can configure a webhook with the `meeting.transcript` event enabled to receive the meeting transcript after the meeting has ended.
You can do this either on our [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/webhooks), or using a [REST API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addWebhook).

## Fetch the meeting transcript

You do not need to rely on the webhook to get the transcript for a meeting. Dyte provides a [REST API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/GetSessionTranscript) using which you can obtain the transcripts for a particular session.
You can use this API to get the transcript for a meeting at a later time. Dyte stores the transcript of a meeting for 7 days since the start of the meeting.

The transcript is received in the form of a CSV. Here is the format of the said CSV:

```csv
Timestamp, Participant ID, Participant Name, Transcript
```

## Testing transcription

Once you have configured a preset and a webhook according to the instructions above, you can proceed to test whether meeting transcription is working for your organization.
To test if meeting transcription has been configured for your organization, perform the following steps.

1. [Create a meeting](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/create_meeting).
2. [Add a participant](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting. Make sure that the preset you use was configured according to this guide.
3. Join the meeting with the `authToken` you just obtained. As you unmute and speak, your speech should be getting transcribed in real-time for all the participants in the meeting.
4. Once the meeting ends, you will be getting a webhook with the event `meeting.transcript`. The body of this webhook will consist of the entire meeting transcript.
